## STEP 5 – Accessing the Wazuh Dashboard

Once installation completes, the installer outputs the dashboard URL
and autogenerated credentials.

By default, the dashboard is accessible at:

`https://<server-ip>`

Log in using the username and password displayed at the end of
the installation process.

If accessing from a host machine, ensure the correct network
configuration or port forwarding is in place.

## STEP 6 – Common Issue: OS Compatibility Check

### Issue
During installation, the installer may report that the operating
system version is unsupported (for example, Ubuntu 24.04).

### Explanation
The Wazuh installer performs an OS version validation check.
This does not necessarily mean the system is incompatible.

### Resolution
The installation can be continued by bypassing the OS check
using the documented override option:

```bash
sudo ./wazuh-install.sh -a --ignore-check
```

### STEP 7 – Validation Checklist (VERY IMPORTANT)

This tells the reader:
> “You didn’t just install — you verified.”

After installation, confirm the following:
```
- Wazuh Manager service is running
- Wazuh Indexer service is running
- Wazuh Dashboard service is running
- Dashboard is accessible via browser
```
If all checks pass, the Wazuh SIEM installation is complete.

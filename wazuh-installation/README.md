# Wazuh SIEM Installation

---

## STEP 1 – System preparation

Ensure the operating system is fully updated so that the Wazuh installer does not
fail due to missing packages or outdated dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
---

## STEP 2 – Downloading the Wazuh installer

Download the official Wazuh all-in-one installer script and make it executable.

```bash
curl -L -o wazuh-install.sh https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-install.sh
chmod +x wazuh-install.sh
```
---
## STEP 3 – Installing Wazuh (All-in-One)

Run the installer to deploy Wazuh Manager, Indexer, and Dashboard on the same server.

```bash
sudo ./wazuh-install.sh -a
```
---
## STEP 4 – Verifying services

Verify that all Wazuh services are running correctly.
 ```bash
sudo systemctl status wazuh-manager
sudo systemctl status wazuh-indexer
sudo systemctl status wazuh-dashboard
```
---
## STEP 5 – Accessing the Wazuh Dashboard

Once installation completes, the installer outputs the dashboard URL
and autogenerated credentials.

By default, the dashboard is accessible at:

https://<server-ip>

Log in using the username and password displayed at the end of
the installation process.

If accessing from a host machine, ensure the correct network
configuration or port forwarding is in place.
